##### MAIN GAME #####

# Central hub

You are on a small town square.
You can see a large nobleman's house. [You can go and knock on the door.|knock]
Next to the house, there's a cage with a tiger in it. [Go take a look.|cage]
A wandering salesman is going around the square, selling his products. [Talk to him.|salesman]
And what about that [strange woman|woman]?

[Push him away and go inside.|not-good-idea]

# Tiger's cage

cage !shed !cage-open

A simple toolshed is nearby.
